# Python Project Best Practice



## Package and Module 

[](http://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/)

## Virtual Environment with venv

For the sake of reproducibility and reducing incompatibility, all library installation and development should be done in virtual environment, with the dependencies logged in requirements.txt shared via git.

### Recreation of virtual environment

Inside this project folder, the empty virtual environment can be created via

```cmd
py -3 -m venv .venv # Windows
python3.x -m venv .venv # Linux/Mac
```

Once the virtual environment is created, run

```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac
```

to activate the virtual environment. and run `deactivate` to leave the virtual environment. **All the following commands should be run inside the virtual environment.**

Install the wanted dependency via

```cmd
python -m pip install NAME
```

Other style/method of installation and package manager (e.g. conda, pipx, without '-m') is not recommended, as it may cause incompatibility issues.  

.venv folder can be shared via git, but the list of dependencies logged in requirements.txt is shared. If you add a new package, run the following command to update the requirements.txt.

```cmd
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

To install all the dependencies listed in requirements.txt, run

```cmd
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Virtual environment in VSCode  

You can select interpreter (and thus virtual envrionmnt) in VSCode the command of 
`Python: Select Interpreter` and select the python.exe inside the .venv folder. for detailed instruction, see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments).
