== Perfect Set

A perfect Set is a set satisfying $A' = A$, then it's not isolated point.

== G\_delta and F\_sigma

$G_delta "has one nondense element or is residual (comeager)"$
$F_sigma "has one element contains open set or is meagre" $

Residual A := A is the intersection of a countable family whose each member is a set with dense interior.
Meagre A:= A is the union of a countable family whose member is a set is nowhere dense.

== Derived Set Sequence is Finitely at Empty Set
Then the set is Meagre.

== Open mapping theorem
Use Baire Category Theorem and the Surjective Fact.
Baire Category Theorem states a sense of closeness of union for no-where dense sets.
