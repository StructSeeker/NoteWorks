epilson of room:\
$f(x) ≤ g(x) ⟷ ∀ 𝜖 : ℝ | 𝜖 > 0 ∴ f(x) ≤ g(x) + 𝜖 $ \
$f(x) gt g(x) arrow.l.r exists epsilon : RR | epsilon > 0 therefore f(x) gt g(x) + epsilon $

the valid region is both closed and open \
suppose the region is closed: \
$p(y) := || f(y) - f(x_0) || lt.eq g(y) - g(x) + epsilon$ \
$S := {x in II | forall y < x therefore p(y)}$ \
by taking limit, S is immediately closed, by the definition of positive derivative of $f^(')(sup S)$ \
we have a upper neighbourhood of f is also in S, thus S is both open and closed. Which take the ensire space.
