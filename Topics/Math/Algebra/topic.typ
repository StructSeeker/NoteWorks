== Dual Space of Linear
$(X -> Y) -> (Y^* -> X^*)$ is an isomorphism iff Y is of finite dimension

proof: consider X -> Y as tensor product.



== Double Dual and Continuation

Double Dual can be viewed as a form of continuation:
$V$, $V -> F$, $(V -> F) -> F$ 

Why double dual is canonical? Because $V -> F$ & $V$'s elements can distinguish each other.

For degenerate bilinear form, ....
